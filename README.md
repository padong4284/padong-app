## Padong

Padong is a community platform that resolves information inequality among students in college life in the US.  Padong provides successful college life know-how through questions and answers to senior students who have experienced and felt directly, not formal information provided by schools. Also, you can use many functions with Padong by integrating functions of fragmented services that are useful for college life.

For example,

* Ask if your class schedule is doable to "[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)"
* Search the location of a building with your classroom in "Google Map"
* Purchase a used calculator in "[used marketplace page in Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/199456403537988/)"
* Search evaluations of professors in "[Rate My Professors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/)"
* Look up classes and make a timetable at "[Courseoff](https://courseoff.com/)"

Without having to use such fragmented services, Padong provides such all functions above in one application.

Colleges in the US offer programs that new students can adapt to school life through orientation, advisor and etc, but the most helpful thing in practice is the senior students who have experienced and felt school life or classes in person. I've seen many cases where first-year students who just entered the U.S. university failed due to insufficient information and eventually dropped out due to class schedules that they couldn't handle. However, I was able to learn about the class of the professor who teaches well with the help of the Korean student council and have been successful academically because I could judge whether the lecture schedule is too much or not. Based on my experience, I came up with a platform called "Padong," which will connect experienced seniors to students who are having a hard time adjusting to school life.
